# DKSR City Intelligence

Hey there 👋, we are the DKSR (Daten Kompetenzzentrum für Stadte und Regionen) City Intelligence team.

We strive to leverage the potential of data 📈 to bring actionable insights 🧐 to the relevant stakeholders.

When navigating our repositories, be aware that we use the following naming convention:
- `exp_*` are exploratory and experimental. 1st stage
- `demo_*` are demonstrator applications where we showcase a specific functionality. 2nd stage
- `ci_*` are CI production ready applications. 3rd stage

Project specific relations we highlight using the corresponding confluence/ jira project key 
- `*_{project_key}*`
